Travel Planner App
Project Overview
The Travel Planner App is a web application that helps users plan their trips by providing essential information about their travel destination. Users can input a city and receive details about the weather forecast, an image of the city, and the length of their trip. The app integrates multiple APIs to fetch data, including GeoNames for geographical information, Weatherbit for weather forecasts, and Pixabay for city images.
